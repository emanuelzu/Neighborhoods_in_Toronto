# Neighborhoods_in_Toronto
Clustering neighborhoods in Toronto

The directory contains the following files:
1. toronto.ipynb - the Jupiter Notebook of my work.
2. 1_Neighborhoods_in_Toronto___map.jpg - map obtained by running cell no. 37 in the Jupiter Notebook.
3. 2_Clustered_neighborhoods_in_Toronto___map.jpg - map obtained by running cell no. 59 in the Jupiter Notebook.

The answer to the first question was prepared in part 1 of the Jupiter Notebook (cells 2 to 18):
"Get the list of postal codes for Toronto region from Wikipedia, build a dataframe containing the corresponding boroughs and neighborhoods, and arrange data according to the requirements".
The output of cell 18 contains the answer to this question.

The answer to the second question was prepared in part 2 of the Jupiter Notebook (cells 19 to 30):
"Get the coordinates for the neighborhoods and attach them to the dataframe".
The output of cell 30 contains the answer to this question.

The answer to the third question was prepared in part 3 of the Jupiter Notebook (cells 32 to 63):
"Segmenting and Clustering the Neighborhoods".
The output of cells 59 to 63 contains the answer. The output of cell 59 is the map of clustered neighborhoods in Toronto attached to this directory (the 2_Clustered_neighborhoods_in_Toronto___map.jpg file).
